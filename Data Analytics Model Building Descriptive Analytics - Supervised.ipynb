When the campus shut down BFS and supporting systems, some students received emails in early January notifying them of possible disruptions to financial aid disbursements.\"More information: http://www.dailycal.org/2016/02/26/campus-notifies-nearly-80000-students...' => HACK\n",

At the time, \\r\\r\\nLinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought\\r\\r\\n were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their \\r\\r\\npasswords as well, just in case.\\r\\r\\nFast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to \\r\\r\\nhaunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to \\r\\r\\nLinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published \\r\\r\\ninformation included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn \\r\\r\\nmember IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each \\r\\r\\nmember profile.

They are also using automated tools to \\r\\r\\ntry and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific \\r\\r\\nLinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and \\r\\r\\nLinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone\\r\\r\\n making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face \\r\\r\\npotential legal action.\\r\\r\\nIn their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved \\r\\r\\nsecurity features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent \\r\\r\\nanother incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, \\r\\r\\nthey noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification\\r\\r\\n for members who are interested in additional security.

The content delivery network quickly confirmed the finding, traced it to a coding error involving just a single wrong character and put related remediations in place.But the leaked data had been cached by major search engines, and the discovery triggered a frantic effort to remove the cached data before the flaw was publicized. Much of the exposed data would have normally been protected by SSL/TLS, but the nature of the vulnerability caused it to be exposed to the internet in unencrypted form.It\\'s unknown how much data may have been leaked, which may make it difficult for companies and users to decide what their most prudent reaction to this bug report should be.\"Cloudflare specializes in improving the performance and redundancy of websites, as well as offering protection against attacks such as distributed denial-of-service. The discovery shows how a weak link in just a single widely used cloud service can have a vast impact on data security downstream.The sensitive data was exposed for \"months,\" writes Google\\'s Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with the company\\'s Project Zero, who found the bug. He jokingly dubbed it Cloudbleed, a portmanteau that recalls the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability (see Heartbleed Lingers: Nearly 180,000 Servers Still Vulnerable).A redacted sample of the leaked data.

But Nick Sweeting, the co-founder and CTO of Blitzka Software, has created a list of 4.3 million websites that use Cloudlfare, and he aims to eventually narrow the list to only display sites left at risk by the coding error.So far, Ormandy has found data on the web from Uber, 1Password, FitBit and OKCupid. 1Password, a widely used password manager, says the data that was exposed was encrypted in two other ways, thus making the Cloudflare bug of little consequence for its users.More Information: http://www.databreachtoday.com/cloudflare-coding-error-spills-sensitive-...' => INSD\n",

But in an update late Monday, DocuSign confirmed that this malicious third party was able to send the messages to customers and users because it had broken in and stolen DocuSign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list of customers and users.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs part of our ongoing investigation, today we confirmed that a malicious third party had gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d DocuSign wrote in an alert posted to its site. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA complete forensic analysis has confirmed that only email addresses were accessed; no names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed. No content or any customer documents sent through DocuSign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eSignature system was accessed; and DocuSign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core eSignature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe company is asking people to forward any suspicious emails related to DocuSign to spam@docusign.com, and then to delete the missives.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey may appear suspicious because you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize the sender, weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expecting a document to sign, contain misspellings (like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdocusgn.com\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without an \\xe2\\x80\\x98i\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or @docus.com), contain an attachment, or direct you to a link that starts with anything other than https://www.docusign.com or https://www.docusign.net,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reads the advisory.If you have reason to expect a DocuSign document via email, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to an email that looks like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from DocuSign by clicking a link in the message. When in doubt, access your documents directly by visiting docusign.com, and entering the unique security code included at the bottom of every legitimate DocuSign email. DocuSign says it will never ask recipients to open a PDF, Office document or ZIP file in an email.DocuSign was already a perennial target for phishers and malware writers, but this incident is likely to intensify attacks against its users and customers. DocuSign says it has more than 100 million users, and it seems all but certain that the criminals who stole the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customer email list are going to be putting it to nefarious use for some time to come.\"' => HACK\n",

      "'\"Earlier this month, KrebsOnSecurity featured a story about a basic security flaw in the Web site of medical diagnostics firm True Health Group\\xc2\\xa0that let anyone who was logged in to the site view all other patient records. In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address\\xc2\\xa0when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem. Molina also said it was trying to figure out how such a mistake was made, and if there was any evidence to suggest the Web site bug had been widely abused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe previously identified security issue has been remediated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause protecting our members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 information is of utmost importance to Molina and out of an abundance of caution, we are taking our ePortal temporarily offline to perform additional testing of our system security.
